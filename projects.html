          <p class="project-description">
            In my software engineering class, I’m collaborating with a small group using an agile
            development process to add new social features to an existing web app modeled after 
            StackOverflow. We’re adding a new following feed to the app and expanding the user 
            profile and user privacy options to enable greater personalization, as well as 
            enhancing existing components like the question filtering system and the 
            upvote/downvote system. The app uses a server/client architecture with a Typescript
            backend and a React frontend. Other dependencies include Express, axios, socket.io,
            and Mongoose for managing the data stored in the MongoDB database.

          <p class="project-description">
            I’m currently working in a small group to develop data visualizations that explore what
            features, such as genre, platform, and publisher, make a video game successful in
            different regional markets. We’re using data visualization libraries like Altair,
            D3, and Plotly to create both interactive and static visualizations, and our analysis
            and explanation of the story we’re presenting will be compiled on a project website.

            <p class="project-description">
              I collaborated to build a two-player game in Java with a GUI using Java’s Swing
              library, structured using the MVC pattern. I worked closely with one other partner
              on design and implementation, compromising on various decisions and using GitHub for
              version control.

            The Council of University Programs Event Management System (SQL), November 2024
          </h4>
          <p class="project-description">
            I worked with a group to create a database application prototype intended to optimize
            event planning, analyze marketing effectiveness, and improve satisfaction with 
            university programs. To do so, I used MySQLWorkbench modeling tools to create the 
            design of the application and used SQL to implement the database alongside features 
            like triggers and stored procedures.

          <h4 class="project-title">FACES Literary Magazine, May 2023</h4>
          <p class="project-description">
            My senior year of high school I was co-editor of the school’s literary magazine, FACES.
            That Spring, I took the lead on compiling and designing layout of the visual art and 
            writing based submissions in Adobe InDesign, as well as coordinating with the printing
            company about a new format and the printing timeline. That year we were able to achieve
            the long-desired goal of having the magazine printed and ready for distribution at the
            school’s Mayfest event in mid-May, allowing us to share the magazine more broadly than
            when it was distributed at graduation in the past.
