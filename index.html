            Hello! My name is Reuben Colten, and I’m a third year Computer Science & English student
            with an analytics focus studying at Northeastern University. People are always surprised
            when I tell them about that combined major— I selected it because of my interest in written
            and verbal communication and my joy for reading, combined with my interest in 
            understanding how the technical tools we use work and how they shape our social reality. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-me">
            Through my coursework I’ve gained experience coding in Java, Typescript, SQL, and python.
            Check out the Projects page to learn more about specific projects I’ve done and continue 
            to work on. I’ve taken classes in literary theory and rhetoric, and right now I’m taking 
            a class about speculative fiction (my preferred reading genre) and graphic novels. At the 
            intersection of both my areas of interest, classes I’ve taken in English and philosophy 
            have focused on how technology intersects with our environmental and social values.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me">
            Recently, I’ve been interested professionally in IT roles because of my desire to learn 
            more about large system architecture and computer hardware more generally. This semester 
            I’ve also had the opportunity to engage more seriously with the frontend part of 
            development, and that’s something I’m eager to learn more about both technically 
            and theoretically.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me">
            In my free time, I enjoy distance running, going to concerts, and reading science fiction.
            I also have four cats who live with my parents in my hometown (New Haven).
          </p>
